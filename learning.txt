In this course, I learned the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, including how to create repositories, make commits, work with branches, and collaborate through pull requests. I also gained hands-on experience using the command line to clone repositories, edit files locally, and push changes back to GitHub. Overall, this course has helped me understand how version control works and why it is an essential skill for teamwork and real-world projects.
